# Embedded System

This folder contains Arduino code (or future code)  and PCB designfor the Super Capacitor Booster Project.

## Usage

To implement the code, simply import it to the Arduino IDE with corresponding library installed.

## Contributing

Charlotte Huang, Roshni Sarma, Megan Singer

## Progress

VoltageRegulator.ino reads voltage of the battery, voltage of capacitor, current of battery to decide whether it boosts, and display the result on the LCD screen.
(Once the other .inos are finished, they will be put on this colunm)
